CMS Version Extraction and Listing:
This is a very crude first attempt at extracting CMS version information from a list of websites.
Often times and for tracking purposes, it is useful to keep track of how website owners keep up with 
CMS versioning in order to stay secure and up to date.

Further improvements coming soon.
